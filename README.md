# InveniOps — Incident Management System (IMS)

## Overview

Distributed systems fail in pieces — a cache node degrades, a queue backs up, an RDBMS
connection pool exhausts — and each piece emits its own flood of error/latency signals
faster than a human can read them. InveniOps ingests those signals at high volume,
collapses repeated noise from the same failing component into a single trackable Work
Item, routes it to the right responder at the right severity, and enforces a workflow
that can't reach "Closed" without a documented root cause. The goal is to turn raw
signal noise into a small number of accountable incidents with a measurable
Mean Time To Repair.

## Tech stack

| Choice | Why | Main alternative rejected |
|---|---|---|
| Node.js 20 + TypeScript (strict) | Single-language stack, compile-time safety across API/domain/infra boundaries | Plain JavaScript — no compile-time guarantees on a codebase this layered |
| Express | Minimal, unopinionated HTTP layer with a mature middleware ecosystem (helmet, cors, pino-http) | Fastify — faster, but no functional need here outweighs Express's ubiquity and lower review friction |
| PostgreSQL 16 + Prisma | ACID transactions for work-item state transitions; typed schema and migrations | Raw `pg` + hand-written SQL — more control, no compile-time query safety, much more boilerplate |
| MongoDB 7 | Schemaless, high-throughput audit log for arbitrary raw signal payloads | Postgres JSONB column — would couple burst signal-write throughput to the transactional store |
| Redis 7 | Sub-millisecond hot-path reads for dashboard state; also backs the queue | In-process cache — doesn't survive restarts or scale past one instance |
| BullMQ | Redis-backed job queue; reuses infra already in the stack, built-in retry/backoff | RabbitMQ — a second broker to run and monitor with no capability this system needs that BullMQ lacks |
| React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind | Fast dev loop, no build config, utility CSS with no library lock-in | Next.js — server-rendering/routing machinery this internal SPA doesn't need |
| Docker Compose | One-command reproducible local stack | Manually-installed host services — worse reproducibility for a reviewer |
| Vitest | Native ESM/TS, fast, same tool front and back | Jest — slower under ESM+TS, more config |
| zod | Runtime validation with inferred static types from one schema definition | Manual checks / Joi — no free TS type inference |
| pino | Structured JSON logs, low overhead, pairs directly with pino-http for request-id correlation | Winston — more configurable, slower, more boilerplate for structured output |

## Setup

**Prerequisites:** Docker Desktop (or a compatible engine) with Compose v2. Node.js 20+
only if you want to run `npm` commands outside Docker (editor tooling, `npm run dev`
against a containerized backend). `make` is optional — every target below has a raw
`docker compose` equivalent, since `make` isn't preinstalled on plain Windows.

**1. Environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Optional — `docker-compose.yml` bakes in the same defaults, so the stack runs without
this step. Copy it if you want to override anything (ports, credentials, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`).

**2. Start the stack**

```bash
make up
# or, without make:
docker compose up -d --build
```

Brings up Postgres, Mongo, Redis, the backend API, and the frontend dev server. The
backend waits for all three data stores to report `healthy` before it starts (see
`depends_on: condition: service_healthy` in `docker-compose.yml`).

**3. Verify**

```bash
docker compose ps                        # all five services Up / healthy
curl http://localhost:3000/health         # {"status":"healthy","dependencies":{"postgres":"up","mongo":"up","redis":"up"}}
```

Open http://localhost:5173 — the connection indicator in the header should turn green
within a few seconds (it polls `/health` every 5s).

**Other targets:**

```bash
make logs        # docker compose logs -f
make down        # docker compose down
make reset       # docker compose down -v   (wipes all volumes — destructive)
make db-shell    # docker compose exec postgres psql -U <POSTGRES_USER> -d <POSTGRES_DB>
```

## Backpressure Handling

**TODO (Phase 2):** document the in-memory buffer's overflow policy, how the ingestion
API sheds or delays load under sustained 10k signals/sec bursts, and how BullMQ backlog
is monitored/bounded.

## API Reference

**TODO (Phase 2):** document ingestion, work-item, and RCA endpoints once the domain
layer exists. Currently only `GET /health` is implemented.

## Design Patterns

**TODO (Phase 2):** document the State pattern (work item lifecycle) and Strategy
pattern (alert severity selection) once `src/domain/` is implemented.

## Testing

**TODO:** expand beyond the current retry-wrapper unit tests (`backend/tests/unit/retry.test.ts`)
to cover the state machine, RCA validation, and debouncer once they exist; add
integration tests against the Dockerized stores.
